The first task:


With our dataset healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv which contains patient information and it also contains information about the existence of a stroke episode or not, which you should predict using Random Forest and dividing the dataset into a 75% -25% training-test .

1A. To perform the dataset analysis and its graphical representation.

B. In this query you are asked to locate and try to handle the missing values with the following methods:
  1. Remove a column
  2. Fill in the values with the average of the column items
  3. Fill in the values using Linear Regression
  4. Apply k-Nearest Neighbors to top up prices.



The second task(neural.py):

With our dataset spam_or_not_spam.csv which contains two columns. The first column contains the text from various emails while the second column informs us whether they were spam or not: value 1 for spam, 0 otherwise. Your goal is to try to predict the information in the second column using a neural network.
